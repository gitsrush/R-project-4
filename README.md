1. Examine how each predictor differs between the spam and nonspam
e-mails by comparing the spam-class average and non-spamclass
average. Identify 10 predictors for which the difference between
the spam-class average and nonspam class average is highest.
2. linear discriminant analysis using the training dataset.
Include only 10 predictors identified.
3. Generate linear discriminants using your analysis.
4. Lift and decile charts for the validation dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in identifying spams.
